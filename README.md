# JavaInDepth

This repo is about the Java Basic Concepts which somehow get missed by most devs while learning Java. Some of these like the Java Memory Model 
are very important to understand how access a data in Normal Java Application works.
(The infamous ++variable mismatch issue on several platforms is based on this.)
Will be updating more as I read.
